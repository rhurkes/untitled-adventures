- dig into the dyn keyword that highlights Console is a trait on the Object.draw function
- check into the handle_keys update from part 2 if we can just pass a map, or need the whole game
- part 2, objects should be a vec and not an array
- part 2 bonus at end:
    - create map as continuous vec
    - treat everything in map as another object
- render_all: should use game obj for dimensions instead of consts
- how would I patch out all the unsafe usage in things like lib.rs for libtcod?
- should Rect from part 3 actually be called a Room?
