- dig into the dyn keyword that highlights Console is a trait on the Object.draw function
- check into the handle_keys update from part 2 if we can just pass a map, or need the whole game
- part 2, objects should be a vec and not an array: this is fixed in part 5. Edit: only some of it is fixed, still review
- part 2 bonus at end:
    - create map as continuous vec
    - treat everything in map as another object
- render_all: should use game obj for dimensions instead of consts
- how would I patch out all the unsafe usage in things like lib.rs for libtcod?
- should Rect from part 3 actually be called a Room?
- all these places where we're downcasting to usize, would it be easier just to use usize?
- look into why you need to dereference a mutable reference to get/set (see: *explored)
- "One might argue that that render_all should not actually modify anything and that the FOV/exploration code belongs somewhere else. They wouldn’t necessarily be wrong. But let’s just roll with it for now."
- I love the name: name.into() thing that converts &str to String
- domain::is_blocked is gross, where to put this?
- place_objects won't place any monsters if it doesn't find an empty tile - should keep checking open spots
- let alive be set in new constructor for objects
- TODO: dig into composition vs. inheritance and how this isn’t a real ECS whatever that means…​
- read constants from a config file
- all these void functions should have rust doc to describe what they're operating on and why
- remove magic numbers like the 2.0 in ai_take_turn
- this mut_two thing from part 6 is gross and should be replaced
- to_draw.sort_by: what is `cmp`? what is a `&&` reference?
- rename consoles in tcod struct, `cons` is a bad name
- deal with too many args in clippy
- deal with Map alias and clippy warn
- deal with use *
- TODO dig into turbofish with placeholder generic collect::<Vec<_>>()
